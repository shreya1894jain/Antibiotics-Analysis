# Antibiotics-Analysis
This visualization demonstrates which drug worked most effectively for each of the 16 bacterial infections listed. The names of the bacteria are sorted according to their gram staining value and the 3 possible drugs for each of the bacteria are represented by a bar graph in the same row to aid quicker analysis. Thus if the audience just wants to view the best antibiotic for a particular bacteria, they can skip to that particular row and view the MIC values for each.  
As mentioned in the visualization, the lower the value of MIC, the more effective will be the antibiotic for that particular bacteria. The ranges of the MIC values have been reduced using the log function as initially they were ranging from 800 to 0.0001 which is very difficult to plot in a graph. This reduced the range from 0 to 3. 
The visualization also takes into consideration the reaction of the bacteria to Gram staining. The colour of the bars will be blue if the gram staining is negative and orange if it is positive.
